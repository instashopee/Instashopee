    <h1>Return, Refund, and Cancellation Policy</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Instashopee. This Return, Refund, and Cancellation Policy outlines the procedures for returning, refunding, and canceling orders placed on our website.</p>

    <h2>1. Returns</h2>

    <p>1.1. We accept returns within 7 days from the date of purchase.</p>

    <p>1.2. To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused and in the same condition as when you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.</p>

    <p>1.3. Certain products, such as perishable goods, personalized items, and intimate or sanitary goods, electrical goods, special order goods, may not be eligible for return. Please refer to the product description for specific return eligibility information.</p>

    <h2>2. Refunds</h2>

    <p>2.1. Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.</p>

    <p>2.2. If your refund is approved, it will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within a certain number of days, depending on your payment provider's policies.</p>

    <p>2.3. Shipping costs are non-refundable, and the customer is responsible for return shipping fees, unless the return is due to an error on our part.</p>

    <h2>3. Cancellations</h2>
